Configuration flow for Govee BLE Lights integration.

This module handles the process of adding new Govee BLE devices to Home Assistant.
It manages device discovery via Bluetooth, user configuration input, and validation
before creating new configuration entries.

The config flow supports two main paths:
1. Bluetooth discovery - automatically detected BLE devices
2. Manual entry - user manually enters device address
